# hyperfine-vqe
A simple two-qubit implementation of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, for a system of two spin-1/2 particles. The hamiltonian to be solved is the hyperfine interaction hamiltonian.

This repository is used in the paper "Studying the hyperfine interaction using the variational quantum eigensolver" by A. Martin, J. W. Martin, and D. E. Vincent.
